Paragraphs are distinct blocks of text which section out a larger piece of writing—stories, novels, articles, creative writing or professional writing pieces—making it easier to read and understand. Good paragraphs are a handy writing skill for many forms of literature, and good writers can greatly enhance the readability of their news, essays, or fiction writing when constructed properly.
